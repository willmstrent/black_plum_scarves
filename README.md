# black_plum_scarves
Website for Black Plum Products.

Black Plum is an experimental design project. A central component of the project is silk twill scarves imprinted with motifs inspired by designs found on heavy machinery.

The website in development here will eventually become an ecommerce site used to sell physical products — scarves, tote bags, t-shirts. The development will be done in stages with incremental progress published as it is completed.

_____________
Stages

1. Design System
Typography, UI components, layout

2. Written Content
I will develop content that creates a context for the product. 

3. Ecommerce
I would like to use the most versatile components to acheive this. So I am leaning toward some type of JAMstack solution. But I will have to balance the amount that I will need to learn with completing the project in a reasonable amount of time.
